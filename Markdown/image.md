# Adding Images

The snippet to add images in the markdown file is as follows:

```markdown
![alternative name](image link url)
```

For example:

```markdown
![Github logo](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/01/30/13/33/github-6980894_960_720.png)
```

The above is rendered as follows:

![Github logo](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/01/30/13/33/github-6980894_960_720.png)
