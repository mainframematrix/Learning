# What is markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language. This is great if you want to take notes, add documentations and guides for a specific topic or project.

## How does it work?

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. This file need to be opened in a markdown application that can understand what is written and parse it into HTML document. This HTML document is used to render the output that you see.
