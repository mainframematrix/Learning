# Creating Links

Links can be helpful to navigate around websites and other markdown files.

To create a link the format remains same for all the use cases.

```markdown
[alternative name](link url)
```

## Link to a website

To create link to a website, for example this repository itself, we follow the snippet above. It would look something like:

```markdown
[Learning Repository](https://www.github.com/sahay-shashank/Learning)
```

The above is rendered as follows:

[Learning Repository](https://www.github.com/sahay-shashank/Learning)

## Link to another markdown file

To create link to another markdown file, for example the `README.md` file of this folder that contains all the indexes. Following the snippet would look something like:

```markdown
[Markdown Index](README.md) # link is relative to the location of this markdown file
```

The above is rendered as follows:

[Markdown Index](README.md)
